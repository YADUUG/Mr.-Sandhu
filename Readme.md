# Study — ELO vs Bayesian (TrueSkill) for a competitive platform (Rivals)

Below is a clear, practical, and implementable study comparing **ELO** and **Bayesian (TrueSkill)** approaches, with a real-world numeric example, step-by-step implementation advice, evaluation strategy, a recommended architecture for Rivals, and suggested future plans.

1. # Short summary / recommendation

- **If you want a simple, lightweight baseline:** ELO is fine for 1v1 and quick prototypes.
- **For a modern team-based competitive platform like Rivals:** a **Bayesian system (TrueSkill or hierarchical Bayesian)** is the better core.
- **Best practical choice for Rivals:** **TrueSkill-style Bayesian core + an ML layer + anti-cheat/anomaly subsystem** (a hybrid). TrueSkill handles teams and uncertainty; ML uses rich match stats to refine expected outcomes and detect anomalies.

2. # How the two algorithms work — explained simply

### ELO (classic)

- Each player has a single number R (rating).
- EA=11+10(RB−RA)/400E_A = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{(R_B - R_A)/400}}
- After a match: new rating RA′=RA+K⋅(SA−EA)R'\_A = R_A + K \\cdot (S_A - E_A), where S_A is 1 for win, 0 for loss (or 0.5 draw), K is sensitivity.
- **Characteristics:** simple, deterministic, win/loss only, fixed K. Team extensions usually average member ratings.

### Bayesian (TrueSkill / general Bayesian)

- Each player has a **distribution** over skill, e.g. Normal(μ, σ). μ = mean skill, σ = uncertainty.
- Match outcome updates each player’s posterior (μ and σ) using Bayesian inference; surprising outcomes change μ more and reduce σ.
- **TrueSkill** is a practical Bayesian implementation designed for teams and variable team sizes; it returns μ and σ and supports ranking, matchmaking, and uncertainty-aware decisions.
- **Characteristics:** models uncertainty, handles teams naturally, can be extended to include more match data (likelihoods).

3. # Real-world numeric example (ELO) — step-by-step arithmetic

**Scenario:** Team A average rating 1500, Team B average rating 1600. K = 32. Team A wins (an upset).

1.  Compute expected score for Team A:

    - RA=1500,RB=1600R_A = 1500, R_B = 1600
    - Exponent: (RB−RA)/400=(1600−1500)/400=100/400=0.25(R_B - R_A)/400 = (1600 - 1500)/400 = 100/400 = 0.25.
    - 100.25=1.778279410038922810^{0.25} = 1.7782794100389228.
    - Denominator =1+1.7782794100389228=2.7782794100389228= 1 + 1.7782794100389228 = 2.7782794100389228.
    - EA=1/2.7782794100389228=0.35993500019711494E_A = 1/2.7782794100389228 = 0.35993500019711494.

2.  Rating change for a Team A player (actual score S_A = 1):

    - Delta = K⋅(1−EA)=32⋅(1−0.35993500019711494)=32⋅0.6400649998028851=20.482079993692324K \\cdot (1 - E_A) = 32 \\cdot (1 - 0.35993500019711494) = 32 \\cdot 0.6400649998028851 = 20.482079993692324.
    - New rating RA′=1500+20.482079993692324=1520.4820799936924R'\_A = 1500 + 20.482079993692324 = 1520.4820799936924.

3.  Rating change for a Team B player (actual score S_B = 0):

    - Expected for B is EB=1−EA=0.6400649998028851E_B = 1 - E_A = 0.6400649998028851.
    - Delta = 32⋅(0−0.6400649998028851)=−20.48207999369232432 \\cdot (0 - 0.6400649998028851) = -20.482079993692324.
    - New rating RB′=1600−20.482079993692324=1579.5179200063076R'\_B = 1600 - 20.482079993692324 = 1579.5179200063076.

**Takeaway:** ELO is numerically straightforward and updates all team members equally if you use team-average ranking.

4. # Real-world conceptual example (TrueSkill / Bayesian)

**Scenario (conceptual):**

- Team A: player A1 (μ=27, σ=2.5), A2 (μ=26, σ=2.0)
- Team B: B1 (μ=25.5, σ=2.5), B2 (μ=25, σ=2.5)

**Conservative skill (μ − 3σ)**:

- A1: 27 − 3×2.5 = 19.5
- A2: 26 − 3×2.0 = 20.0
- B1: 25.5 − 3×2.5 = 18.0
- B2: 25 − 3×2.5 = 17.5

TrueSkill considers the distributions and the match result; if Team B pulls an upset, their μs increase and σs decrease, and winners’ μs increase more the more surprising the outcome. After several games, σ shrinks for consistent players. You _don’t_ get a single deterministic number — you get skill estimates plus confidence.

**Why this matters:** Two players could have similar μ but very different σ — Bayesian uses that to avoid overconfident matchmaking; ELO cannot.

6. # Step-by-step implementation plan (recommended for Rivals)

### Phase A — Prototype (0 → 2 weeks)

1.  **Data ingestion**: normalize CSV/streaming match rows into a matches table (MatchID, timestamp, players, teams, kills, assists, objectives, winner).
2.  **Baseline: ELO**:

    - Implement ELO for fast baseline.
    - Save ratings, leaderboards.
    - Use ELO to sanity-check TrueSkill later.

3.  **Run offline comparisons**: compute ELO & TrueSkill on historical matches and compare rank order, volatility.

### Phase B — Bayesian Core (2 → 4 weeks)

1.  **Add TrueSkill**:

    - Use trueskill (Python) or equivalent lib.
    - Maintain ratings\[player_id\] = (μ, σ).
    - For each match, call rate(\[teamA_ratings, teamB_ratings\], ranks=\[...\]).
    - Persist ratings in DB (Postgres or Redis for quick reads).

2.  **Conservative rating**: show skill_estimate = μ - 3σ for matchmaking to prioritize proven players.

### Phase C — Add ML & Features (4 → 8 weeks)

1.  **Train ML model** (XGBoost/LightGBM) to predict match outcome and individual contribution, using features: kills, deaths, assists, accuracy, headshots, objective_score, time_played, map, mode, party_size.
2.  **Hybrid update**:

    - Use TrueSkill as prior.
    - Use ML to compute likelihood or expected contribution per player.
    - Adjust TrueSkill updates (or post-process μ) using ML signals (e.g., increase Δ for players who exceeded ML prediction).

3.  **Anti-cheat & anomaly detection**:

    - IsolationForest or One-Class SVM on player feature distributions.
    - Flags feed into rating system to freeze or discount suspicious matches.

4.  **Evaluation & metrics**:

    - Offline: predictive accuracy (log loss) of win prediction; ranking correlation (Kendall Tau) vs ground truth; calibration of predicted probabilities.
    - Online: A/B test TrueSkill vs ELO for match fairness and retention.

### Phase D — Production & Monitoring (ongoing)

1.  **API & UI**: endpoints for /player/{id}/rating, /leaderboard, /player/{id}/history.
2.  **Monitoring**: watch rating drift, sudden σ drops, anomaly flags, and business KPIs.
3.  **KYC & anti-fraud**: escalate for withdrawal requests.

7) # Evaluation: how to decide which works best

- **Offline tests**

  - Predict next-match winner using past ratings: measure AUC / log loss.
  - Rank correlation: Kendall Tau between predicted ranking and realized match outcomes.

- **Simulations**

  - Synthetic data: simulate players with true latent skill, run both systems, check how quickly each recovers true skill and how noisy they are.

- **Online A/B**

  - Randomly route some matches into ELO and others to TrueSkill-based matchmakers. Measure match fairness, queue time, retention, dispute rate, and player satisfaction.

8. # Why TrueSkill (Bayesian) is best for Rivals — concise bullets

1)  **Team-native** — matches team games without shoehorning.
2)  **Uncertainty awareness** — essential for cold starts and safe matchmaking.
3)  **Flexible** — easy to extend with ML likelihoods and role-specific models.
4)  **Fairness** — conservative estimates avoid mismatches and maintain user trust.
5)  **Anti-fraud synergy** — Bayesian posterior behavior (sudden jumps, low σ) helps flag suspicious patterns.

Key design notes:

- Persist each match record and rating delta.
- Keep rating updates idempotent (store processed match IDs).
- Support batch recompute for model changes.

10. # Future plans / roadmap (6–18 months)

**Short term (0–3 months)**

- Deploy TrueSkill core, DB persistence, leaderboard API.
- Add anomaly detection (Isolation Forest) on top of conservative rating.

**Medium term (3–9 months)**

- Build ML model (XGBoost) to predict win probability and player contribution; use it to refine match expectations.
- Test hybrid updates that give a small ML-informed boost to TrueSkill deltas.
- Add confidence UI for players: show μ ± σ and “games needed to stabilize”.

**Long term (9–18 months)**

- Hierarchical Bayesian model: separate role-specific skill (sniper vs support) and contextual priors (map, weapon).
- Online learning (streaming): adjust parameters in near-real time.
- Anti-cheat arms race: incorporate sequence models over input logs to detect human vs bot behavior.
- Research: fairness adjustments, bias detection, and calibration to prevent exploitation.

11. # Practical tips & pitfalls

- **Do not use usernames as keys** — use Player_ID.
- **Store and re-run deterministically** — store processed match IDs to avoid double updates.
- **Tune draw probability & β (TrueSkill params)** to match your game’s variance.
- **Use conservative rating in matchmaking** (μ − kσ with k=2..3).
- **Integrate anti-cheat early** — false data can poison the rating system.

13. # Final verdict — what to pick for Rivals

- **Core engine:** **TrueSkill (Bayesian)** — because Rivals is team-based, needs uncertainty, and must be fair.
- **Enhancements:** Add an ML layer using match stats to refine expectations, and a strong anti-cheat/anomaly system that can discount suspicious games.
- **Why hybrid:** Bayesian gives principled probabilistic updates; ML gives signal richness (kills, accuracy, objective performance); the anti-cheat system protects the integrity.

If you’d like, I can:

- Convert this into a one-page technical design doc for your README.
- Produce a working repo scaffold (TrueSkill + ML scoring + REST API) using your DataSet.csv.
- Run an offline evaluation (Kendall Tau, predictive AUC) on your dataset to compare ELO vs TrueSkill vs hybrid.

Which of those would you like next?
